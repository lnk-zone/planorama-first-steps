-- First, let's see what policies already exist
-- Drop any existing policies and recreate them to ensure they're correct
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own profile" ON user_profiles;

-- Now create the correct policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own profile" ON user_profiles
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);
